      <h2>What is Ecofest?</h2>
      <p>Ecofest is a yearly festival that we hold on the stray to spread the messageof global warming and how we can help save our planet. Ecofest is a good time to relax and chill with your friends as you all party the night away. 75% of all the money collected over the duration of the festival will go to cleaning our oceans and saving our planet. We will be hosting 4 bands throughout the night to ensure you have the best time of your life!</p>
      <h2>Why do we run Ecofest?</h2>
      <p>We run Ecofest because we believe that we can make a difference to this planet through the use of music as well as having a good time. We want to acheive a plastic free ocean and a safe and happy environment for everyone. We believe that by giving the public a fun and open space to listen to music and party that this would bring more customers in,and more money to help our world.</p>
      <h2><br />
      What do we aim to acheive?</h2>
      <p>We aim to acheive an audience that has a more in depth understanding of how we effect the environment, but more importantly how we can help to fix our planet and how we treat it. The money we earn will be going towards helping the environment and cleaning our oceans. We aim to ensure thta no one is left out and everyone feels like part of a team.</p>
      <p>To reduce our left over plastic waste, we are introducing a new smart water system. We are using edible water bottles that will be sold for 20p each, these water drops are fully edible and leave so waste behind. {and are very cheap!}</p>
